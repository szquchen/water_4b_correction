This is a potential energy surface that corrects the 4-body interaction in MB-pol [1].

Two subroutines are provided: correction_4b_E, and correction_4b_EG; the former calculates the energy correction to MB-pol 4-b, and the latter calculates the correction for energy and gradient at the same time. The input for both subroutine is the Cartesian coordinate of a water tetramer, in bohr. The atoms must be in order H H H H H H H H O O O O.
