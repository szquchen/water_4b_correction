# 4-body Correction to the MB-pol water potential

This is a potential energy surface (PES) that corrects the 4-body component of the MB-pol water potential [1-3]. Note that the MB-pol can be downloaded at https://github.com/paesanilab/MBX; our PES only calculates the correction.

A brief description for each folder is given below; more details can be found in README files inside the folder.

## src_fit folder
This folder contains the data set used for this potential and the program that performs the potential fitting.

## coef folder
The linear coefficients obtained from the fit are inside this folder

## src_pot folder
This folder contains the code to compute the corrections.
